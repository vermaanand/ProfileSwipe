# ProfileSwipe
# Tinder-like Swipe Profile Feature in SwiftUI
# Overview
This project provides a Tinder-like swipe profile feature built with SwiftUI. It allows users to swipe through profiles (such as cards with images, names, and descriptions) and interact with them using various actions like Like, Message, and Hide. The design features smooth swipe animations, a clean UI, and a profile card stack.

# How to Use
To integrate this feature into your own SwiftUI app, follow the steps below:

1. Clone/Download the Repository
    - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    - Open the project in Xcode.
2. Add Profile Data
    - The app uses a Profile struct to represent each profile. Modify or add your own profiles in the CardStackView struct.
3. Display Swipeable Profiles
    - The SwipeProfileFeatureView view is the main entry point for displaying the swipe profiles. It consists of a stack of profiles, swipe actions, and a UI with Like, Message, and Hide buttons.
    - Integrate the SwipeProfileFeatureView wherever you'd like the swipe functionality in your app.
